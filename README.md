Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

Overview
The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard is an interactive web application that visualizes the bacterial species found in the human belly button. The data is displayed through various charts that provide insights into the diversity of microbiomes among different individuals. Users can select a specific individual from a dropdown menu to view detailed information about the bacterial species found in their belly button.

Features
Interactive Charts: Bubble chart and bar chart that display the abundance of different bacterial species.
Metadata Display: View demographic information and metadata for each individual.
Responsive Design: The dashboard is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
Dynamic Data Loading: Data is fetched dynamically from a JSON file and rendered using D3.js and Plotly.js.
